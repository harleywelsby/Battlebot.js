# Battlebot.js
This is a work-in-progress Discord bot that allows users to train in various "moves" and level them to fight in pokemon-style battles against other members of the server.

This bot was initially built with Python and the Discord.py library, although due to Discord.py's discontinuation, has been adapted to Javascript with Discord.js in this repository. The original bot's code can be found here: https://github.com/harleywelsby/BattleBot

### Please note that in its current state, Battlebot is only built to handle single-server operation and does not currently have multi-threaded or guild-specific functionality.
