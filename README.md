# Battlebot.js v2
This branch restores the initial Battlebot.js functionality, before the slash command restructure. The latest build is Main, but if you want to find older versions they will be stashed here.

This bot was initially built with Python and the Discord.py library, although due to Discord.py's discontinuation, has been adapted to Javascript with Discord.js in this repository. The original bot's code can be found here: https://github.com/harleywelsby/BattleBot

### Please note that in its current state, Battlebot is only built to handle single-server operation and does not currently have multi-threaded or guild-specific functionality.
